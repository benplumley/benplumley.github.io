====================

My personal website

This website uses [makestatic](https://github.com/benplumley/makestatic) to generate flat HTML files from the PHP files that I edit.
The dynamic folder contains the PHP files.

It is hosted on GitHub pages at [benplumley.github.io](http://benplumley.github.io). The address is [benplumley.com](http://benplumley.com).
