**Propositional Calculus**  
A proposition, or statement, is either true or false. This is known as its *truth value*. Propositions are represented as letters, like variables in algebra.

*Conjuction* is the propositional connective equivalent to logical *AND*. It is defined as follows:  

| x | y | x and y |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 1       |

*Disjunction* is equivalent to logical *OR*.
